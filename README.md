# Predicting Human Survival in Forest Environments using SAR and RGB Imaging Techniques

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for predicting human survival in forest environments using advanced imaging techniques, including SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and RGB imaging. The project involves generating RGB images with legends from SAR images (VV and VH) to map water bodies, aiding in the prediction of survival scenarios in such environments.

## Objectives
- **Predict Human Survival:** Utilize SAR and RGB images to analyze forest environments and predict potential human survival scenarios.
- **Generate RGB Images with Legends:** Convert SAR images (VV and VH) into RGB images with legends to clearly represent water bodies and other critical features.
- **Water Body Mapping:** Accurately map water bodies using SAR imaging data to enhance survival predictions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather SAR (VV and VH) and RGB images of forest environments.
   - Collect environmental data like temperature, humidity, and vegetation types relevant to human survival.

2. **Image Processing:**
   - Convert SAR images to RGB format using image processing techniques.
   - Annotate RGB images with legends to highlight key features such as water bodies and dense vegetation.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Develop machine learning models to predict survival scenarios based on the processed images.
   - Use the RGB images with legends as inputs to improve prediction accuracy.

4. **Water Body Mapping:**
   - Implement algorithms to identify and map water bodies using SAR data.
   - Integrate water body maps into the survival prediction models.
